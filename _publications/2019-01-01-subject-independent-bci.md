This paper presents a subject-independent Brain-Computer Interface framework based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks that eliminates the need for time-consuming individual calibration procedures. The proposed method achieves higher classification accuracy compared to traditional subject-dependent models using a large-scale motor imagery EEG database from 54 subjects.
