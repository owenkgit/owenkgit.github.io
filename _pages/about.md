I graduated with an MS from Carnegie Mellon University, focusing on robotics under the guidance of Prof. Jean Oh and Prof. Amir Barati Farimani.

My research addresses rapid adaptation of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to new environments with minimal resources. I explore how natural language instructions—ranging from coarse directives like "be safe" to specific commands like "move 20% slower"—translate into physical action corrections through post-training alignment. Key areas include skill-based action tokenizers for stable long-horizon control, retrieval frameworks that autonomously gather robot data with minimal supervision, and test-time adaptation of robotic systems through human feedback.
