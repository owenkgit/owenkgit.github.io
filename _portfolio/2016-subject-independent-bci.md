## Overview
Developed a subject-independent (calibration-free) non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on deep convolutional neural networks that classifies a user's imagined movements without requiring individual calibration.

## Key Innovation
Traditional BCI systems require approximately 20-30 minutes of calibration time to collect enough data to build a reliable decoder for each user. This research eliminated that requirement through a subject-independent approach using deep learning.

## Key Achievements
- **Large-Scale Database**: Utilized motor imagery (EEG) database from 54 subjects
- **CNN Framework**: Developed subject-independent framework based on deep CNNs
- **Superior Performance**: Outperformed traditional subject-dependent models (CSP, CSSP, FBCSP, BSSFO)
- **Top Publication**: Published as first author in IEEE TNNLS (top 1% journal in Machine Learning field)

## Technical Approach
- Focused on non-linear characteristics of EEG data
- Combined deep learning with brain signal processing
- Extracted discriminative brain features from large-scale database
- Binary classification of motor imagination (right or left hand)
