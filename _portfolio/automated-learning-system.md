## Overview
Developed an RL-based AutoML system that automatically constructs task-specific pipelines for biosignal data analysis, demonstrating performance comparable to expert-trained models.

## Key Achievements
- **End-to-End Automation**: Automatic construction of pipelines from preprocessing to architecture design
- **Time-Series Optimization**: Designed search space specifically suited for time-series data
- **Controller Development**: Developed controller to manage expansion of search spaces
- **Expert-Level Performance**: Achieved results comparable to manually tuned expert models

## Motivation
Task-specific design in biosignal processing requires high levels of expertise and is time-consuming. This project aimed to reduce the specialized knowledge required for designing neural networks by automating the entire process.

## Technologies
Reinforcement Learning, AutoML, Model Training, Hyperparameter Optimization, Time-Series Analysis, ECG Data Processing
