I graduated with an MS from Carnegie Mellon University, focusing on robotics under the guidance of Prof. Jean Oh and Prof. Amir Barati Farimani.

My research addresses rapid adaptation of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to new environments with minimal resources. I explore how natural language instructions—ranging from coarse directives like "be safe" to specific commands like "move 20% slower"—translate into physical action corrections through post-training alignment. Key areas include skill-based action tokenizers for stable long-horizon control, retrieval frameworks that autonomously gather robot data with minimal supervision, and test-time adaptation of robotic systems through human feedback.

## News

Dec 2025 Two arXiv preprints are forthcoming on runtime VLA adaptation and semantic skill construction.

Sep 2025 One paper RT-Cache: Training-Free Retrieval for Real-Time Manipulation got accepted to Humanoids 2025.

Jan 2025 Received CMU's Academic Excellence Fellowship.

Aug 2024 Awarded CMU's Department Head's Fellowship.
