## Overview
Developed AI-based early prediction and classification models for cardiology patients, capable of predicting events such as cardiac arrest using Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data.

## DeepCARS Project
Created a system that calculates the likelihood of cardiac arrest using five vital signs:
- Heart Rate (HR)
- Respiratory Rate (RR)
- Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)
- Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)
- Body Temperature (BT)

## Key Contributions
- **Study Design**: End-to-end pipeline from data processing to architecture design and evaluation
- **Data Processing**: Raw data preprocessing, data cleansing, and missing data imputation
- **Feature Engineering**: Batch sampling for data imbalances, feature quantization
- **Architecture Design**: Sequential models including LSTM, Transformer, and ensemble methods

## Achievements
- Created prototype deployed in Korean hospitals
- Predicts cardiac arrest 24 hours in advance, enabling life-saving interventions
- Published four papers in clinical journals (co-first author on three papers)
