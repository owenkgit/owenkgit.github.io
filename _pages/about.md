I graduated with an MS from Carnegie Mellon University, with a focus on robotics. I was advised by Prof. Jean Oh and Prof. Amir Barati Farimani. My main research is how to rapidly adapt VLAs (Vision-Language-Action models) to new environments with minimal resources. Language ranges from coarse ("be safe") to specific ("move 20% slower"), with inherent ambiguity. I aim to learn how natural language instructions translate into physical action corrections through post-training alignment.

Additionally, I work on skill-based action tokenizers for stable long-horizon control and retrieval frameworks that autonomously gather robot data with minimal supervision.
